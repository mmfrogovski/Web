            <h1>The story</h1>
            <p>Riko lives in a town perched on the edge of The Abyss, a vast network of unexplored lands that are filled with monsters, relics, and untold mysteries. Together with her friends, and under the guidance of the Leader and the Director, Riko trains to be a Cave Raider by frequently excavating for any treasures she can find. There are more things to be found out there than old bones though, and when she happens upon the unconscious form of a robotic boy named Regu, Riko realizes she's only just begun to discover the secrets that lie hidden in the Abyss.</p>

        <h1>The Game</h1>
        <p>Made in the Abbyse features a vast open world for Link to explore. Most of Hyrule's scenery is accessible by walking, paragliding or climbing. While the game still includes barriers (such as weather effects, inhospitable environments or strong enemies), many of these can be overcome by using Food, effective weapons and armor or finding alternate routes. The world also includes an elaborate physics system which allows for creative interactions (e.g., cutting down a tree and using its trunk as a raft on a river, or setting grass ablaze and spreading the fire with wind gusts).
Unlike many previous Abbys games, Made in the Abbyse does not enforce a specific order in which quests or dungeons have to be solved, with the exception of completing the starting tasks on the Great Plateau. It is possible to challenge Ganon right after leaving the starting area, though the game does encourage exploration in order to solve Ancient Shrines (and thus gaining additional Hearts or Stamina), find useful and powerful equipment, and defeat the game's own version of dungeons, the Divine Beasts. Additionally, many of the game's puzzles can also be solved in various different ways, often rewarding Link for creative solutions.
Controls
Link's controls in Made in the Abbyse are reminiscent of previous 3D Abbyse games. However, the game is the first to require manual jumps as opposed to auto-jumping over small gaps which was introduced with Ocarina of Time and a long-time staple of Made in the Abbyse series.
Cooking
A new feature introduced with Made in the Abbyse is Cooking, which enables the creation of Food that recovers Hearts and bestows various effects on Link. Meals are cooked by broiling up to five edible Materials at cooking pots, such as meat, berries, fruits or herbs. Elixirs can be mixed by including monster parts in various recipes. Depending on chosen ingredients, Link's health will be replenished and/or he will receive effects such as Elemental Resistance, additional Stamina or Hearts, or buffs to his Defense or Attack.
Equipment and Durability
Link can equip a huge variety of different weapons and armor in Made in the Abbyse, allowing for adaptation to the ever-changing environment of Hyrule and tactics used by different enemies. Notably, almost all weapons found in the game will break after a certain amount of hits. This new Durability system often forces Link to use weapons gained from enemies, even weak ones, instead of just wielding the best sword available in the game.
Rune Abilities
Completing the initial four Ancient Shrines on the Great Plateau bestows Link with four Rune abilities: Magnesis, Stasis, Cryonis and Remote Bombs. These abilities allow Link to manipulate the environment by lifting magnetic objects, freezing objects (and later enemies) in time, creating blocks of ice on water surfaces, and summoning bombs. Together with climbing and paragliding, these abilities are used throughout the rest of the game and (for the very most part) sufficient to solve puzzles and access most of Hyrule. As a consequence, the game does not feature traditional dungeon items that grant abilities to Link.</p>
